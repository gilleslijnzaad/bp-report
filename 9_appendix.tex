  \caption{The driving simulation for the non-construction condition.
  The orange arrow on the left of the dashboard is the indicator that blinks three times once the participant presses the blinker.
  The number at the center of the dashboard shows the current driving speed. 
  At the top and on both sides of the screen are mirrors in which the participant can see the autocar when it is behind them.}

  \caption{The driving simulation for the construction condition. The leftmost lane is closed off by a row of pylons and the remaining lanes are more narrow than in the non-construction condition. The autocar can be seen in front of the simcar.}
