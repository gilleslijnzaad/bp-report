[To be added: summary of introduction.]
This study aims to investigate a number of things: (1) whether a driver's level of working memory load (WML) can be predicted by current pupil size;
(2) whether there is an interaction between WML and visuospatial demands on pupil size; 
and (3) whether there is a correlation between mental effort and saccades to the speedometer.
A simulated driving experiment with eye-tracking was conducted where participants drove on a highway for 60 minutes. 
WML was manipulated by an \(n\)-back task (\(n = 0,1,2,3,4\)) performed by means of speed regulation.
Visuospatial demands were manipulated by a change in the driving environment, namely a construction site with reduced lane width.
Results show that pupil size is a successful predictor for WML. \@
However, no interaction with visuospatial demands was found.
