% ----- GENERAL EXPLANATIONS -----
% driving
Driving a car is a challenging task, cognitively speaking. 
It is a ``dynamic control activity in a continuously changing environment'' \citep[p.~18]{DeWaard1996} 
involving processing a large amount of stimuli and constantly updating a mental model of the environment.
And, non-trivially, it requires making appropriate decisions to ensure the safety of both the driver and the drivers around them.

% ----- RESEARCH QUESTIONS -----
This study aims to investigate the following questions concerning working memory load (WML) while driving. 
Firstly, can the current level of WML be predicted by pupil dilation? 
Secondly, something with visuospatial demands. 
And finally, does the frequency of saccades to the speedometer correlate with the current level of mental effort (i.e.\@ WML and visuospatial demands)?\@ 
% WHAT ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN WML AND VISUOSPATIAL DEMANDS?

% ----- HYPOTHESES -----
Since pupil dilation is correlated with arousal \citep{Mathot2018} and therefore with mental effort it is expected to be a predictor for WML.\@
In the context of the current experiment this would mean that an increase in pupil dilation predicts that the participant is performing a high \(n\)-back level.

(2) hypothesis
Lastly, the hypothesized correlation between mental effort and saccades to the speedometer follows from cognitive load theory.
A driving task that is highly demanding (either visuospatially or mnemonically) allows little mental space to concern oneself with the speedometer.
In contrast, an easy driving task leaves plenty of cognitive resources for checking the speedometer.
Therefore, a negative correlation between mental effort and saccades to the speedometer is to be expected.

% OPERATIONALISATION
In order to test these hypotheses a simulated driving experiment was conducted.
It largely follows the approach of \citet{Scheunemann2019} who studied the interaction between WML and visuospatial demands while driving using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
Their experiment involved participants driving a car on a highway in a realistic simulation. 

% working memory load
WML was manipulated through an \(n\)-back task, which is considered to be a standard measure of working memory in cognitive neuroscience \citep{Kane2007}.
The task was integrated into the driving process by means of speed regulation, meaning participants were instructed to drive according to the speed sign that occurred \(n\) signs ago.

% visuospatial demands
Visuospatial demands were manipulated by contrasting two driving environments: \textit{construction} and \textit{non-construction}.
In the non-construction condition participants drove on a regular three-lane highway.
In the construction condition the leftmost lane was closed off by a continuous row of pylons.
Further, the remaining two lanes were of reduced width, increasing driving difficulty.
