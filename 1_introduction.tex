\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
% driving
Driving a car is a challenging task, cognitively speaking. 
It is a ``dynamic control activity in a continuously changing environment'' \citep[p.~18]{DeWaard1996} 
involving processing a large amount of stimuli and constantly updating a mental model of the environment.
And, non-trivially, it requires making appropriate decisions to ensure the safety of both the driver and the drivers around them.

% RQs + hypotheses
This study aims to investigate the following questions concerning working memory load (WML) while driving. 
Firstly, can the current level of WML be predicted by pupil dilation? 
Secondly, something with visuospatial demands. 
And finally, does the frequency of saccades to the speedometer correlate with the current level of WML?\@

% OPERATIONALISATION
In order to test these hypotheses a simulated driving experiment was conducted.
It largely follows the approach of \citet{Scheunemann2019} who studied the interaction between WML and visuospatial demands while driving using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
Their experiment involved participants driving a car on a highway in a realistic simulation. 

% working memory load
WML was manipulated through an \(n\)-back task, which is considered to be a standard measure of working memory in cognitive neuroscience \citep{Kane2007}.
The task was integrated into the driving process by means of speed regulation, meaning participants were instructed to drive according to the speed sign that occurred \(n\) signs ago.

% visuospatial demands
Visuospatial demands were manipulated by contrasting two driving environments: \textit{construction} and \textit{non-construction}.
In the non-construction condition participants drove on a regular three-lane highway.
In the construction condition the leftmost lane was closed off by a continuous row of pylons.
Further, the remaining two lanes were of reduced width, increasing driving difficulty.
