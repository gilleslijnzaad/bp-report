\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The task of driving a car is a ``dynamic control activity in a continuously changing environment'' \citep[p.~18]{DeWaard1996}.
It involves processing a large amount of stimuli and constantly updating a mental model of the environment.
I'm also citing \citet{Paxion2014}.
